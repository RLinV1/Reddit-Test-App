# React + Vite
Task: Build a simple community portal (Reddit-style) that allows users to:

• Register/login

• Post a short message or link

• Upvote/downvote posts

• View posts in a feed, ordered by most upvoted



Bonus (optional):

•  Responsive design for mobile

•  Use of frameworks like React (web) or React Native/Flutter (mobile)

•  Basic admin dashboard to remove inappropriate posts



 You may use any tech stack you’re comfortable with (HTML/CSS/JS, Django, Flask, Node.js, etc.)
